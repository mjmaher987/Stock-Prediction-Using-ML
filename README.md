# Stock-Prediction-Using-ML
Predicting Stock and Currency Prices Using Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Tools


## Milestones
I.	Milestone 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing (Week 1)
- [x]	Collect historical stock and currency price data from reliable financial sources.
- [x]	Preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure consistent scaling across features.
  
II.	Milestone 2: Data Partitioning and Model Definition (Week 2)
- [x] Divide the preprocessed data into training, validation, and test sets.
- [x] Define the 6 models to be used: Transformers, LSTM, Simple RNN, Ichimoku, NHits, and NBeats.
  
III.	Milestone 3: Model Training and Validation (Week 3)
- [x]	Train each model using the training data and appropriate optimization algorithms (e.g., Adam, RMSprop) with suitable learning rates.
- [x] Utilize the validation set to fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal model performance.
  
IV.	Milestone 4: Model Evaluation and Comparative Analysis (Week 4)
- [x]	Evaluate the predictive accuracy of each model using evaluation metrics such as MSE, RMSE, and MAE.
- [x]	Conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis to identify the most accurate and reliable model.
  
V.	Milestone 5: Discussion of Results and Conclusion (Week 5)
- [x]	Present the findings of the comparative analysis, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each model.
- [ ]	Discuss the models' suitability for stock and currency price prediction in different market conditions.
- [ ]	Address potential limitations and challenges encountered during the research.
- [ ]	Summarize key findings and emphasize the model that demonstrated superior performance.
- [x]	Draw conclusions, discuss implications, and suggest future research directions.
